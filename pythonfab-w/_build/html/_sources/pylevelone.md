##  Curriculum

The curriculum for Python Level I contains 14 learning objectives.



## Learning Objectives 1-6

The first six learning objectives will get you started. You will learn how to setup your Python "cockpit" for programming. The cockpit (VS Code) is what many professional programmers use. You will write and execute your first couple of Python programs. And, finally, you will get a first overview of the most important concepts of programming.

## Learning Objectives 7-12


The next six learning objectives get at the core foundational concepts you need on your journey to master Python. We will begin with the basics of computer architecture so you begin to understand what happens "under the hood" when you are programming. The you will learn about the "objects" in Python, beginning with primitive objects (atoms) and then collections (molecules). You learn how to perform operations on both. Then you will be introduced to control flow through iteration and branching. You will also learn about indices and slicing, which are critical concepts when working with ordered sequences and collections.

We will finish up by learning how to write your own functions. We will also explain how functions in programming are related to mathematical functions. The final learning objective is a first introduction to debugging.
