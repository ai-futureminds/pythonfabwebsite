# <font color ="maroon"> Welcome </font>

**Welcome to Python for Absolute Beginners**. PythonFAB is a free online program designed for busy professionals who want to learn how to program quickly and efficiently. 

You will learn to "code" in Python. But our objective is also to teach you: 

> the art of computation, the power of abstract thinking, and how to navigate technical complexity. 

Your takeaway will be the practical skills you can apply in the workplace, not just today or tomorrow but for a lifetime.
