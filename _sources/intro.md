- **Python Master I ("Professional Development Environment")**. Think of your journey as learning to fly an airplane. The first step is to master the instrumentation in the cockpit of a modern airplane. In the first mini-course you will learn how to setup a professional development environment, including VS Code and Git.

- **Python Master II ("Fundamentals")**. In the second mini-course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of programming in Python. These include data structures, iteration, branching, and functions. As you get familiar with the instrumentation, you will begin to write your first Python programs to reinforce the main concepts.

- **Python Master III ("Applied")**. In the final mini-course, you will go on your first "solo flight" using Python. You will use Python to build a "real" end-to-end web application for tracking personal finances. The lessons will include constructing the application layout, separating business logic from the user interface, implementing basic security, adding a data persistence layer, and deploying it to the cloud.
