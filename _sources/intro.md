# <font color ="maroon"> Welcome to PythonFAB</font>

**Welcome to Python for Absolute Beginners**. PythonFAB is a free online program designed for busy professionals who want to learn how to program quickly and efficiently. You will learn to "code" in Python, but our objective is also to teach you: 

- the art of computation 
- the power of abstraction
- the nuances of technical complexity

Your takeaway will be the practical skills you can apply in the workplace, not just today or tomorrow but for a lifetime.

# <font color = "maroon"> Why Python? </font>

Python is the *de facto* programming language for the Age of AI. It can be applied to traditional tasks such as web development and network analysis. But Python is also the essential gateway language for scientific computing, data science, and the cluster of emerging technologies around AI.


# <font color = "maroon"> Sessions </font>

All sessions are announced in the [Meetup Python for Absolute Beginners](https://www.meetup.com/python-for-absolute-beginners/). Please join the group (it's free) to receive current information about events and activities.


# <font color = "maroon"> Discord </font>

If you have questions or need support throughout your journey of learning Python, Data Science, or AI, we encourage to join the AI-FutureMinds Discord Channel. The Discord channel is spelled **ai_futureminds** (with an underscore).
