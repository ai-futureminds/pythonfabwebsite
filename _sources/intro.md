- **Python Master I ("Professional Development Environment")**. Think of your Python journey as learning to fly an airplane. As a first step, the pilot must master the instrumentation in the cockpit. In the first mini-course, you will learn the basics of the Python cockpit. The primary instruments you will lear are VS Code, the Command Line or Terminal environment, and Git. 1) VS Code is powerful code editor but it is also the cockpit in which other instruments are incorporated. 2) The Terminal or Command Line environment provides direct communication with the operating system. It allows users to perform various tasks such as managing files and directories, running scripts, and launching applications. It's a powerful tool that gives users more control over their system and is widely used in software development and system administration. 3) Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.  It tracks and records changes to files in a repository so you can see what was changed, who changed it, and why. It's widely used in software development for source code management.

- **Python Master II ("Fundamentals")**. In the second mini-course, you will learn the fundamental concepts of programming in Python. These include data structures, iteration, branching, and functions. As you get familiar with the instrumentation, you will begin to write your first Python programs to reinforce the main concepts.

- **Python Master III ("Applied")**. In the final mini-course, you will go on your first "solo flight" using Python. You will use Python to build a "real" end-to-end web application for tracking personal finances. The lessons will include constructing the application layout, separating business logic from the user interface, implementing basic security, adding a data persistence layer, and deploying it to the cloud.
