# <font color ="darkblue">Why AI-FastStart?</font>

The consensus view among economists is that **AI** will be the ***primary engine of economic growth*** and ***innovation*** for at least the next decade. The majority of high-paying jobs will be in **AI** and related sectors. According to a recent study by McKinsey, **AI** is likely to add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. 

```{div} styled-quote
>  <span style="color:darkgreen">**AI-FastStart**</span> is designed to equip you with both the <span style="color:darkgreen">**business** and **technical skills**</span> essential for securing <span style="color:darkgreen">**high-paying jobs**</span> in the new economy. 
```

Do you want to spend tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in class, only to find out a couple of years later that you are in debt and have acquired mostly useless knowledge? Instead of making a long term commitment to a program that might not be the right fit for you, is there a better way?
