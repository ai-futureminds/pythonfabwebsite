# <font color ="maroon">Why AI?</font>

The consensus view among economists is that <span style="color:maroon">**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**</span> will be the ***primary engine of economic growth*** and ***innovation*** for at least the next decade. The majority of high-paying jobs will be in <span style="color:maroon">**AI**</span> and related sectors. According to a recent study by McKinsey, <span style="color:maroon">**AI**</span> is likely to add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. (McKinsey & Co, [The economic potential of generative AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier), June 2023)

According to a leading economist, **Erik Brynjolfsson**, *Stanford Professor* and *Director of the Stanford Digital Economy Lab*, many of the crucial jobs and opportunities will be for managers and business leaders who understand and can harness the potential of AI.

# <font color ="maroon">Why AI-FastStart?</font>

**AI-FastStart** represents an alternative to "Business-as-Usual-Learning." By "Business-as-Usual-Learning" we mean acquiring practical skills through traditional pathways or the plethora of expensive programs. The problem with both approaches is that you don't learn everything you need ("learning gaps") and acquire a lot that you don't need ("wasted learning").

With "Business-as-Usual-Learning" you can end up spending tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in class, only to find out much later, after all the expense and effort, that you are saddled with debt and don't have the practical skills you need to move forward. Instead of making a long term commitment to an uncertain program that might not be the right fit for you, maybe it's time to ask if there is a better way?

# <font color ="maroon">What is AI-FastStart?</font>

<span style="color:darkgreen">**AI-FastStart** </span> program consists of a set of online bootcamps. 


```{div} styled-quote
> The bootcamps emphasize <span style="color:darkblue">*foundational knowledge*</span> and <span style="color:darkblue">*practical skills*</span>. At each step, you learn <span style="color:darkgreen">**just enough**</span> of what you need to know and then <span style="color:darkgreen">**apply the learning**</span> towards practical results. Finally, you should reflect and integrate your experience towards your larger journey. At each stage, you decide whether you are learning and whether you are ready to move forward.
