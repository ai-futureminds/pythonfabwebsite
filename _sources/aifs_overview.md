# <font color ="darkblue">Business as Usual Learning</font>

The problem with "Business as Usual Learning" is that you don't learn everything you need and acquire a lot that you don't need. The first creates a learning gap or holes in your learning, The second leads to wasted learning.

You can spending tens of thousands of dollars of funds and hundreds of hours in class, only to find out much later that you are saddled with debt and don't have the practical skills you need to move forward with your life. Instead of making a long term commitment to a program that might not be the right fit for you, maybe it's time to ask if there is a better way?
