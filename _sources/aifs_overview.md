Our first AI FastStart program is **Python Foundations**. It consists of three mini-bootcamps. At the end of the bootcamps, you should have enough basic Python knowledge to advance to specialized paths in web programming, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. For those on a business or management track, the Python Foundations sequence will give you a basic working knowledge of programming.
