In the final bootcamp, you will undertake your first solo flight in Python. You will build a "real" end-to-end web application for tracking personal finances. The lessons will include constructing the application layout, separating business logic from the user interface, implementing secure authentication or login, adding a data persistence or database layer, and deploying your final application to the cloud.
