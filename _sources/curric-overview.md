- **Python Master I Bootcamp ("Professional Developer")**. Think of your Python journey as learning to fly an airplane. As a first step, the pilot must master the instrumentation in the cockpit. In the first bootcamp, you will setup a Professional Development Environment ("cockpit") for programming in Python. The primary instruments you will learn are VS Code, the Command Line or Terminal environment, and Git. 1) VS Code is powerful code editor but it is also the cockpit in which other instruments are incorporated. 2) The Terminal or Command Line environment provides direct communication with the operating system. It allows users to perform various tasks such as managing files and directories, running scripts, and launching applications. It's a powerful tool that gives users more control over their system and is widely used in software development and system administration. 3) Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.  It tracks and records changes to files in a repository so you can see what was changed, who changed it, and why. It's widely used in software development for source code management.

- **Python Master II Bootcamp ("Python Fundamentals")**. In the second bootcamp, you will learn the fundamental concepts of programming in Python. These include data structures, iteration, branching, and functions. At the end of the bootcamp, you will have a good overview of the main elements of programming in Python. You will also begin to write your first Python programs using the Profession Development Environment learned in the first bootcamp.

- **Python Master III ("Python Applied")**. In the final bootcamp, you will learn how to build a "real" end-to-end web application for tracking personal finances. The lessons will include constructing the application layout, separating business logic from the user interface, implementing basic security, adding a data persistence layer, and deploying it to the cloud. You will be able to personalize and refine the application based on your own needs as they evolve.
